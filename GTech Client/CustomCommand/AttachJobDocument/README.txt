This command may be deprecated with a foreign key query interface; however, leaving the code here for now but not promoting the script to the Database folders so the command won't exist in the system for now.

If this command is, indeed used, then the table defined/populated in the configuration script needs to be deprecated in lieu of entries in SYS_GENERALPARAMETER (using the MASTER SCRIPT)
