ISSUES ADDRESSED:

 * Activity Code
   (ALM 581 - Incorrect Activity Code for MapCo WR/Job Type)
     
     Testing of activity codes set in MAPCO WRs has been inhibited by a bug in the WMIS interface which 
     has been overwriting the Job Type (WR-MAPCOR) with the WR Type (MAPCO). This script contains the 
     corrected package, which should preserve the Job Type and thus cause the correct activity codes to be used.

 * Service Center Edits
   (ALM 672 - Error Message When Connecting A Substation Breaker to A Substation Bus)

     A new attribute edit control was added in 00.03.07 to restrict edits on the Service Center attribute 
     for Substation Breaker to users with the PRIV_MGMT_SSTA role. This should not prevent the system from 
     automatically updating the attribute, but the new rule was misconfigured to prevent both interactive 
     and programmatic updates. This patch reconfigures the interface type so it only restricts updates 
     via Feature Explorer, and not programmatic updates.

 * CU Library
   (no ALM issue)

     Based on feedback from the integration team, population of value lists after refreshing the CU library 
     has been failing for five of the tables due to datatype mismatches. This script alters datatypes for 
     those five tables in the AEGIS database to accommodate the values arriving from WMIS.

 * Modification Log
   (no ALM issue)

     Resynchronizes the modification log to ensure proper display of features whose component views 
     were altered in 00.03.07 (e.g.- Secondary Conductor, Service Line)

 * CU Capacitor Typo
   (no ALM issue)

    Hexagon QA found a metadata typo that caused an error when trying to select a CU for a Capacitor feature.  
    This script removes the extraneous carriage return character that slipped into the attribute name metadata.
