AEGIS SYSTEM PATCH NOTES
------------------------------------------------
version:    00.03.09
patchset:   01

ISSUES ADDRESSED:

 * WMIS Integration

   This fix includes updates to allow testing of the full WR lifecycle:
    - Centralized updates to the WMIS Status code in the AEGIS Job table within the WMIS batch processing module,
       for improved reliability; the module will set WMIS_STATUS_C = BATCH as it begins processing for a given WR
       and then set it to SUCCESS or FAILURE before exiting.
    - Added exception handler to new job table trigger that parses designer ID, to ensure an exception does not
       interrupt subsequent processing.
    - Added a new role PRIV_INTERFACE for shared integration resources, and granted it privileges on the INTERFACE_LOG
       and INTERFACE_XML_DATA tables in the GIS_STG schema.
    - Added missing configuration metadata for the Write to WMIS custom command in order to facilitate continued testing.
